        <p><i>Learn how the Verida Network enforces privacy and security of user data within a decentralized environment</i></p>

        <p>The <strong>Verida Private Data Bridge</strong> (this application) and <strong>Verida Private Data APIs</strong> (also part of this application) are deployed on the first iteration of Verida's Confidential Compute infrastructure. This infrastructure is designed to find the optimum balance between decentralization, security, privacy and performance.</p>

        <a name="compute" />
        <h2>Confidential Compute</h2>

        <p>This application is running within a confidential computation environment. This means that no-one, not even the underlying infrastructure provider or Verida can access any user data or view the computation occurring on the node.</p>

        <p>The first iteration of Verida's Confidential Compute nodes are running inside <a href="https://www.marlin.org/oyster">Marlin Oyster</a> Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). These nodes provide numerous security guarantees and capabilities:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Computation occurs within a secure enclave where the node operator has zero visibility</li>
            <li>SSL terminates within the secure enclave, eliminating man-in-the-middle attacks</li>
            <li>Server code is verified to be the expected code</li>
            <li>No data is stored to external disks. All data is secured in memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Verida Foundation is operating the first cohort of Confidential Compute nodes and will open up to node operators in the future.</p>

        <h2>Confidential Storage</h2>
        <p>Verida APIs integrate the Verida Client SDK within the secure enclave on each confidential compute node. User data is syncronized from the Verida network, decrypted and then loaded into memory for rapid access via API endpoints.</p>
        <p>As such, user data retains all the security and privacy benefits of the Verida Network and user data never leaves the secure enclave, accept via user authorized API requests.</p>

        <a name="llm-privacy" />
        <h2>LLM Privacy</h2>
        <p>The large language models (LLM) currently used in the Verida APIs are not currently running in a Verida Confidential Compute secure enclave. Secure enclaves do not currently support GPU access which is necessary for performant LLM operations. The alpha release is using Amazon Web Services Bedrock for LLM access.</p>

        <p>This is a temporary solution as we are collaborating with partners to enable LLM's to run efficiently and cost effectively within secure enclaves. While this is not perfect, we believe the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/security-compliance/">AWS Bedrock privacy architecture and security model</a> is an adequate compromise for the alpha release.</p>

        <a name="private-key" />
        <h2>Private Key / Seed Phrase</h2>
        <p>You enter your private key or seed phrase into this application to connect to the Verida Confidential Storage network. Your credentials are stored in local storage and cached in the secure enclave for rapid access. You can clear them at any time by clicking your name / avatar in the top right of the page and logging out.

        <h2>Source Code</h2>
        <p>The source code for the User Data APIs are open source and are contained within the <a href="https://github.com/verida/data-connector-server">Data Connector Server Github Repo</a></p>
