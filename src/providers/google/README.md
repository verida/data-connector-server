# Notes

`pdf-parse` is used to convert PDF files to text so their contents can be searched. There is a bug in the library that causes this message to be output to the console when fonts can't be found: `Warning: TT: undefined function: 32` (see https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/3768#issuecomment-36468349)

## Refresh Tokens

Google only provides a `refreshToken` when a user first connects their account. If the user attempts to reconnect, the second OAuth process will only return an `accessToken`.

# Known issues

1. Emails are processed in batches, up until the expiry date, then starts to fetch new again. Need to refactor to use range tracker helper.
